# Project Description

This is our team's first group project where we created a one page app that allows a user to search for electric vehicle charging stations nearby or at a specific location/city based on the city that they input in the search bar. The page initially loads a home page with a search bar, a search icon, a menu icon, and an automatically generated map loads with pinneed charging stations near their current location (based on their IP Address). The user has the ability to click on the search bar and input a city of their choice and once they select an autocompleted city and click on the search icon, the page will load up pinned charging station locations found within their searched city. If the user clicks on the menu icon a side nav bar will pop up where the user is able to click on the section titled (Nearby) which then displays a dropdown list of all charging stations located in the city they have searched, with some extra information about each specific charging station, as well as a star icon where the user is able to save a specific charging station and add it to their favorites. Underneath the Nearby section, there is a favorites section which will include the user's favorited locations. On the map itself, the user is able to click on a specific pin where a card with information about that specific charging station is displayed; within the card, the user is able to click to save and open google maps nto navigate to the pinned location that they selected. At the bottom of the page, the user is able to click on the github icon which will redirect them to our project's repo page on github.
